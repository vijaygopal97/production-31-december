    "reason": "QC Batch Processor Bug: Responses with Option 8 (Fraud interview) were incorrectly changed from Rejected to Pending_Approval by the old batch processor code, then auto-approved. All affected responses have been reverted back to Rejected status.",
    "bugDetails": {
      "bugDescription": "The old QC batch processor code (before Jan 13, 2026 fix) was changing ANY response status to Pending_Approval without checking the current status. This caused Rejected responses (with Option 8) to be changed to Pending_Approval, and then auto-approved when batch approval rate was high.",
      "fixApplied": "The fix ensures batch processor only processes responses that are already in Pending_Approval status, preventing changes to Rejected, Approved, or abandoned responses.",
